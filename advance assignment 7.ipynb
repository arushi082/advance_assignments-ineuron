Whereas the code inside the except block will execute whenever the program encounters some error in the preceding try block. the else clause on the try-except block which must be present after all the except clauses.

The with statement itself ensures proper acquisition and release of resources.Thus, with statement helps avoiding bugs and leaks by ensuring that a resource is properly released when the code using the resource is completely executed. The with statement is popularly used with file streams, as shown above and with Locks, sockets, subprocesses and telnets etc.It is like Try finally block "
